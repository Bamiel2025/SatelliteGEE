# Satellite Image Analyzer Implementation Summary

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the implemented satellite image analyzer application with Google Earth Engine integration.

## Application Overview

The Satellite Image Analyzer is a web application that allows users to:
1. Enter location names which are converted to coordinates
2. Select before and after dates for satellite image comparison
3. Choose from various environmental event types for specialized analysis
4. View side-by-side satellite images with interactive comparison
5. Perform area and distance measurements
6. Generate analysis reports with recommendations

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend (React.js)
- **Framework**: React with functional components and hooks
- **Styling**: CSS with responsive design
- **Mapping**: Leaflet with React-Leaflet for interactive maps
- **State Management**: React built-in state management
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and building

### Backend (Python)
- **Framework**: Flask for REST API
- **GEE Integration**: Google Earth Engine Python API
- **Geocoding**: OpenStreetMap Nominatim API
- **CORS**: Flask-CORS for cross-origin requests
- **Environment Management**: python-dotenv for configuration

### Key Components

#### 1. User Interface
- **Control Panel**: Location input, date selection, event type selection
- **Split Map View**: Side-by-side comparison of before and after images
- **Event Filter**: Specialized analysis options for different environmental events
- **Measurement Tools**: Area and distance calculation tools
